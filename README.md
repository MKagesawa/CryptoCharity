# CryptoCharity
Uses visitor CPU to Mine Monero and Donates to Charity

Visit Site Here: (https://mkagesawa.github.io/CryptoCharity/)
 
## Concept
Most people are reluctant to help charities either because they say they do not have enough money to donate or no time to volunteer.
CryptoCharity lets the visitors utilize unused CPU power to mine cryptocurrency and donate to the Charity they are passionate about.
Since cryptocurrency transactions are carried out on a distributed ledger, anyone can verify through the public address of our site and the target charity that donations were made.
Cryptocurrency has low international transaction fees which I believe significantly benefits the end recipient.

## Warning
Currently, Monero is mined on our website which makes transactions anonymous and untraceable.
This is because Monero miner API was easiest for me to use.
In the future, I want to mine other coins with high transparency, low transaction fee and can be mined efficiently through Web JavaScript.
Any contribution will be appreciated!

## Built with
[Coinhive](https://coinhive.com/) - JavaScript Monero Miner API
